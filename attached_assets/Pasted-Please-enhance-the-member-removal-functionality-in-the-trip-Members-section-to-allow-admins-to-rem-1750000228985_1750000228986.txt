Please enhance the member removal functionality in the trip "Members" section to allow admins to remove users from a trip with proper handling of:

Submitted expenses

Added itinerary activities

🔧 Requirements:

1. Admin-Only Access
Only trip admins should see and use this feature.

The “Remove Member” button should only appear to admins.

2. Confirmation Modal Before Removal
When an admin clicks “Remove” on a user, show a confirmation dialog with the following:

Warning message: “This action will remove [user name] from the trip. Please choose how to handle their submitted activities and expenses.”

Two independent toggles (with tooltips):

🗑 Remove their activities from the itinerary

🗑 Remove their submitted expenses from the expense tracker

If either toggle is left off, their respective content remains but is labeled “Created by former member” (for reference).

Include “Cancel” and “Confirm Removal” buttons.

3. Itinerary Activity Handling
If “Remove their activities” is toggled ON:

Delete all activities created by that user.

If OFF:

Keep the activities, but:

Remove their RSVP

Label the activity card (e.g. “Created by a removed user”)

Disable editing for other users (unless admin)

4. Expense Handling
If “Remove their expenses” is toggled ON:

Delete those expenses from the system.

If OFF:

Keep the expenses, but:

Mark them clearly (e.g. faded style or label: “From removed member”)

Prevent them from being edited by other users (except admins)

Ensure they still count toward trip expense totals unless explicitly removed

5. Data Consistency & Safety
Ensure this action:

Does not break summary totals or shared balances

Does not affect RSVP logic or trigger re-renders unnecessarily

Is fully synced to backend and UI updates gracefully

6. UI Feedback
Show a success toast: “User removed. Selected items handled as requested.”

If the user was the last admin, block the action and show an error: “You cannot remove the last admin from this trip.”

7. Do Not:
Change the RSVP logic for other users

Modify unrelated form logic or trip settings

Alter the trip's styling or layout
